ChangeLog:
- November 14, 2013: ADDED NOTES ON SOLVER AND HOW TO RUN -- DBH


***************************** HOW TO *****************************
Notes:
- A simple three block (i.e. CCM) case file for testing reaction kinetics
- system/APOLLOControlDict sets up details for the APOLLO Solver.
	-warning that in this version the THV kinetics are unstable and the option should be left
	using the butler-volmer formulation for the anode.

How to run:
- Universal Settings:
	-transport properties are set in each domain under constant
	-operatingConditions holds the table for the range of voltages, system/controlDict 
	chooses how many points to do and what point to start on
- Serial Runs:
	-fcCleanCase or fcCleanRun (the later if you want to keep the existing mesh)
	-fcCaseSetup (not required a mesh exists and fcCleanRun was used)
	-fcSerialRun (runs and launches a monitor window)
- Parallel Runs:
	-the number of entries in the hosts.lst determines the number of processors
	-fcCleanCase or fcCleanRun (the later if you want to keep the exisiting mesh)
	-fcCaseSetup (not required if a mesh exists and fcCleanRun was used)
	-fcDecompose (note that fcCleanCase or fcCleanRun require this to be re-run after)
	-fcParallel (generally execute this with "&" to move to a background process)
	-fcMonitor (launch a xterm to monitor the case iterative output)
